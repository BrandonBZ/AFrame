			Today we reviewed the community norms we had created the first time we met. These norms not only establish basic rules and guidelines for us as a community, but also engage us in learning how to govern ourselves. We took into account our own personal interest, goals and history to establish this rules, and we used the word <i>“Ubuntu”</i> as our base, which means <i>“I am, because we are”</i>. These norms will be in action for the rest of the summer and our time here. <br>
